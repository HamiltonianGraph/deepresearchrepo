# deepresearchrepo
David Shapiro (https://github.com/daveshap) invited users of Google and OpenAI's Deep Research tools to post their outputs to public repos, as the research tends to be high quality and on niche topics that are not generally publicly accessible. Agreeing with David's idea, I've created this repo of my deep research projects. This readme files notes the prompts used to create them, and the underlying model used.

I grant permission for anyone to reuse these research documents for information, republication (with attribution - make sure people know the research is AI generated), and AI training data.
